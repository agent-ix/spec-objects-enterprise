# Test Matrix

## Overview

This matrix is the verification contract for the module: the manifest
activation requirement (FR-001, issue #1 era) and the issue #4 semantic module
contract (US-001, FR-002..FR-005, NFR-001, IT-002). Coverage is complete when
every acceptance criterion, named constraint, and NFR metric maps to at least
one test case. Rows are `🚧` until a tagged test asserts them, and the rows
that stay `🚧` are the ones whose evidence needs an environment this repository
cannot provision (a running `filament-core-service`, a Quoin built from main).

## Test Matrix Rules

1. Every acceptance criterion and named constraint has at least one test case.
2. Both Properties forms (typed table, `sysml` fence) and every object type are tested.
3. Item-rule boundaries are tested at their allowed and refused edges (zero versus one identity field, zero versus one temporal field, absent versus present unit, empty versus one-item arrays).
4. Every named refusal (digest mismatch, unknown key, both forms, dangling clause, non-Identifier token, out-of-set relation verb) has a failing fixture.
5. Availability states (`available`, `not_applicable`, `unavailable`) are tested per declaration kind.
6. Legacy artifacts, the empty record, and unresolved tokens are covered as edge cases.

## Test Environment

Every `Integration` row that names Quire runs against the Quire wheel FR-005
Inputs pins, provisioned by `make dev-quire`. That wheel is not on any index
this repository may commit a dependency against (`internal-pypi` serves 0.33.0
at most); `agent-ix/quire-rs#392` is the blocking issue. The suite **fails**
rather than skips when `extract_semantic` is absent, so no row here can be
reported green without the engine under test. The one exception is TC-061, an
explicit expected failure while `agent-ix/quire-rs#391` is open.

Rows over the record keys the extractor does not populate (`relations`,
`scope`, `outcomes`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `stages`, `alternatives`, `targets`,
`measure`, `thresholds`, `owner`, `lifecycle`, `provenance`) are verified
against hand-built records, not extracted ones — TC-033, TC-035, TC-037,
TC-041, TC-042 in particular — and their tests say so; they are schema
evidence, not extraction evidence.

## Coverage Gaps

Every criterion, constraint, and metric above has a row. Two evidence-plan
artifacts are absent and are carried by the plan, not by this matrix: no
`SuiteRegistry` document declares a producer for the `Unit`, `Integration`,
`Inspection`, `Demonstration`, and `Manual` evidence kinds, and no `Inspections`
document exists to discharge the `Inspection`/`Demonstration`/`Manual` rows (TC-005, TC-006, TC-017, TC-018, TC-027,
TC-058, TC-065, TC-070). Rows remain `🚧` until the implementation lands a
tagged test for them.
